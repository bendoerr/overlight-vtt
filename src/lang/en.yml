  virtue:
    spirit:
      name: Spirit
      name-caps: SPIRIT
      color: White
      text: >-
        The power of the soul. Rarified. Ascending. Crystalline and triangular.
        It is the color of light itself. White, it is all colors, and none at
        all.
    wisdom:
      name: Wisdom
      name-caps: WISDOM
      color: Violet
      text: >-
        The Violet light. Wisdom is life's experience, distilled and cunningly
        refined. Both instinct and insight, piety and awareness. Wisdom is the
        compass of the mind, and the sole method for navigating the ordeals of
        your initiation and becoming. It is circular, stable. Encompassing and
        clarifying.
    logic:
      name: Logic
      name-caps: LOGIC
      color: Blue
      text: >-
        The ability to reason, to analyze. To sift through information,
        codified data, and memory. Logic can build, make plans, and discern
        subtle differences. From nothing comes something -- science,
        mathematics, invention. The blue light of Ligic is chain-like,
        reductive, and linear.
    compassion:
      name: Compassion
      name-caps: COMPASSION
      color: Green
      text: >-
        Upon realizing that the dichotomy of self and other is a self-imposed
        delusion, we care connected to the activity of the primordial cosmos
        itself. Compassion is the activity of this cosmos as well as its law.
        The green light of the growing life of these seven shards, of which we
        are a part. Compassion is sympathy, empathy, communication and
        connection.
    will:
      name: Will
      name-caps: WILL
      color: Yellow
      text: >-
        Like an arrow of intent, Will is the force of the self. The willpower
        to establish your being, to formulate your needs and claim them from
        the world. Will is also a shield. Its own defense, a bulwark against
        the assault of others. Its light is yellow, reflected off the face of
        a gold coin, a theoretical idea turned into tangible reality.
    vigor:
      name: Virgor
      name-caps: VIGOR
      color: Orange
      text: >-
        Stamina and speed. Vigor is hungry and hot. It is two sticks furiously
        rubbed together to beat back endless darkness and cold. Hearth fires
        burn and families gather for warm feasts. The flow of the blacksmith's
        ember as it turns iron to its color. The flesh of the world made manifest
        in honey or amber. Vigor is the body as an object which is cared for,
        optimized, and protected. Orange is its color.
    might:
      name: Might
      name-caps: MIGHT
      color: Red
      text: >-
        The engine that drives the body. The force of that body. Might is the
        abject result of pure power and strength. The killing blow, the
        unstoppable force, and the capacity to persist under vile
        circumstances, it is brute strength and simple persistence. Muscle and
        mountains, iron and blood. The virture of war and the hunting of
        titanic beasts. A fist squeezing red fire into intention.
